# Risl - Rust-Inspired Scripting Language

A scripting language with a syntax similar to Rust and an interpreter written
in Rust.

Risl is an academic project to learn Rust, how to design a new scripting
language and its interpreter, following the book
[Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

It is inspired by other similar projects like:

- https://github.com/rune-rs/rune
- https://github.com/tdp2110/crafting-interpreters-rs
