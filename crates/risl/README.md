# Risl - Rust-Inspired Scripting Language

[![Linux Build & Test](https://github.com/juliencombattelli/risl/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/juliencombattelli/risl/actions/workflows/linux.yml)

A scripting language with a syntax similar to Rust and an interpreter written
in Rust.

Risl is an academic project to learn Rust, how to design a new scripting
language and its interpreter, following the book
[Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

It is inspired by other similar projects like:
- rhai - https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai
- rune - https://github.com/rune-rs/rune
- rustc - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
